Registration Form Application - Code Overview

This README provides an overview of the structure and components of the Registration Form Application code.

Project Structure:

- User.java: Defines the User class with attributes for name, phone, and password.
- RegistrationForm.java: The main class that creates the Swing-based registration form, handles user input, and interacts with the database.
- RegistrationForm.form: The XML file generated by IntelliJ IDEA's form designer, defining the layout and components of the registration form.

Code Components:

1. User Class:
   - Defines a simple User class with attributes for name, phone, and password.
   - Used to represent user data.

2. RegistrationForm Class:
   - Extends JDialog to create a registration form window.
   - Contains Swing components:
     - JTextFields for name and phone input.
     - JPasswordFields for password and confirm password input.
     - JButtons for registration and cancel actions.
     - JLabels for field descriptions.
     - JPanel to organize the components.
   - Implements event listeners for the register and cancel buttons.
   - Validates user input, checks for password confirmation, and registers users in a MySQL database.
   - Provides a main method for running the application.

3. RegistrationForm.form (XML):
   - Generated by IntelliJ IDEA's form designer.
   - Defines the layout, positioning, and properties of Swing components.
   - Provides a visual representation of the registration form's design.

Database Interaction:

- The code connects to a MySQL database named 'demodb' using JDBC.
- It inserts user data (name, phone, password) into the 'users' table.
- It performs basic error handling and displays error messages when registration fails.

Running the Application:

- To run the application, execute the main method in the RegistrationForm class.
- The registration form window will appear, allowing users to input their information.
